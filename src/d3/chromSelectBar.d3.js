/*
This component is a linear chart that displays the chromosomes in a given genome.

Component takes the following:
- A parent element (to get the width and height from)
    - Consider just passing the width and height as arguments
- A reference chromosomes object
- brush: Allow brush (optional: default false) - if true the user will be able to select a region of the genome

- An 'options' object with any of the following properties:
    - centromeres: A centromere object (optional) if there are no centromeres chromosomes will not have the additional centromere band component
    - bands: A banding object (optional)
    - pointsOfInterest: A list of points of interest (optional) - these are points that will be displayed on the chart for quick reference
    - maximumSelection: A maximum selection size (in base pairs) (optional) - used to limit the size of the selection to a reasonable size for the user to work with if not present will default to 1000000 base pairs
    - selectionCallback: A callback function that will be called when the user selects a region of the genome (optional) - the function will be passed the start and end base pair positions of the selection

Functions:
- User can select a region by brushing over the chart
- User can click on a point of interest to center the brush on that point
