# SV.iobio: Structural Variant Visualization for Case Analysis

SV.iobio is a powerful, interactive tool designed to assist with visualizing and analyzing structural variants (SVs) from variant call files (VCFs). Users can upload files from their local system or an HTTP-accessible link, select samples, and explore genomic variants in an intuitive interface.

Key Features:

🔍 Dynamic Chromosome Map – SVs are mapped to chromosomal locations, allowing users to zoom in and visually inspect regions of interest.

🖱️ Interactive Exploration – Click on SVs to view detailed annotations, including overlapping genes, phenotypic associations, and population frequency data.

🧬 Gene & Phenotype Integration – Enter HPO terms (Human Phenotype Ontology) or genes of interest, and the application will highlight relevant overlaps with structural variants.

📊 Variant Overlap & Population Data – The tool checks for common SVs, identifies overlaps with known variants from aggregated population sources, and provides insights into gene dosage sensitivity.

⚡ Efficient Case Analysis – Designed to streamline structural variant interpretation, helping researchers and clinicians quickly identify clinically relevant alterations.

This tool is designed to enhance case analysis workflows by providing a clear, interactive, and informative view of structural variant data, helping researchers and clinicians investigate genomic alterations more effectively.
